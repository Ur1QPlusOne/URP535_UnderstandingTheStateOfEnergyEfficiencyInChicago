            The purpose of this project is to provide a macro-overview of the city's energy efficiency trends as a way to understand it further, and this doesn't require address information. \
            Another consideration is to remind ourselves that because this is a dataset required of only large buildings (50,000+ sf), certain areas with smaller buildings on average might be \
            underreported or represented.  Lower income wards may especially be impacted due to the correlation between lower-income neighborhoods and disinvestment rates. \
            Existing or other energy efficient buildings such as Passive Houses or WELL certified buildings may be left out of this data as a result of this despite being extremely sustainable. \
            However, as a means of understanding energy efficiency in the city, utilizing the data that is present is also important as a means of visualizing gaps in the city's energy efficient building stock. \
            By highlighting what areas are sustainably thriving from the city's perspective, this project provides a valuable perspective in understanding the cross-section of Chicago's existing energy infrastructure, policy, and investment.")
